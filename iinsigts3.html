            User interface (UI) design is said to be the process designers use to build 
            interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing <br> on looks or style. 
            Designers aim to create interfaces that users find easy to use and pleasurable.
        </p>
        
        <p class="p">In simple terms, UI design patterns are simply recurring solutions that 
            solve common UI design problems. Design patterns serve as <br> standard reference
            points for user interface designers. We utilize design patterns to shape our work 
            and, as a result, design similar <br> -looking user interfaces.</p>

        <p class="p">
            UI design patterns are used everywhere on sites and apps, and are familiar 
            to users. A user will quickly understand what to do within <br> an interface 
            designed with common UI design patterns. Adopting common patterns means you
            can leverage this knowledge and <br> increase the ease of use of your product.
            UI design patterns make designing a reliable solution to an interface design
            problem a lot <br> faster. For collaboration sake,
            UI design patterns also provide a common language for designers, 
            which keeps conflicts to a <br> minimum, and aids consistency when multiple
            designers are working on the same project. </p>
        
        <p class="p">
            Depending on the project, UI design patterns will still need 
            to be adapted to the specific use case. UI design patterns are similar. <br>
            They offer a general structure we can work off of and add,  subtract or 
            alter parts to tailor it to a particular set of requirements <br> unique to 
            each design project. The first step to utilizing design patterns is 
            defining the problem you’re tackling. With a clear problem <br> in mind, 
            dig into your favorite UI design pattern library. Open up on the category that best fits your need.
        </p>
        <p class="p">Some of the common UI design</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li id="list"> Content Structuring: These patterns are concerned with how your site is organized in a way that feels intuitive and accessible. </li>
            <li id="list">Social Sharing: These patterns facilitate the promotion and sharing of content onto various social media platforms.</li>        
            <li id="list" > Navigation: Navigational patterns help guide users around the interface, ensuring they’re able to find their way back to the <br> homepage if they get lost.</li>
            <li id="list">Input/Output: These patterns include various forms that allow users to submit information, or receive feedback from the site based on an action.</li>
        </ul>

        <p  id="p">
            Popular UI design pattern libraries include UI Patterns, Mobbin, Patternfly,
            UI Garage, etc. There are a lot of other libraries available <br>
            online (Google is your friend, lol). 
            After proper sweep through the internet, if no pattern fits the problem you’re
            trying to solve, or you <br> cannot find one to use as a structure, feel free to draft up your own.
            However, you should test your work to help you identify possible <br> pain points and optimize before you launch.
        </p>

            UI patterns help designers create interfaces that are efficient and save time on coming up 
            with a solution that already exists in the <br> world of UI design. They might seem like a lot 
            to take in, but once you get the hang of them, they’ll make your design process go a lot <br> smoother. Easy peasy!
